        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Noh masks occupy a singular place in the history of world theater. Carved from lightweight Japanese cypress and finished with layers of gofun gesso and urushi lacquer, a mask is not merely a prop but an instrument that extends the actor’s body into a sculpted vocabulary of expression. At first glance a classical mask—say, the serene ko-omote of a young woman—appears fixed and inanimate. Yet Noh actors are trained to tilt the object minutely so it catches light from above at carefully rehearsed angles. A slight downward rotation darkens the eye hollows and deepens the mouth, reading as grief; an upward rotation washes the planes with brightness, reading as joy. This optical technique, sometimes described in relation to the front-facing shōmen viewpoint, lets a single mask contain contradictory feelings without changing its form. The actor’s control of micro-movements becomes a kind of animation.</p>
      <p>Scholars typically group masks into several lineages: okina for ritual beginnings; onna for female roles; otoko for male roles; kishin for deities and demons; and various aged or mad figures that complicate the borders between human and otherworldly. Among the most famous is hannya, whose horned visage signifies a woman transformed by jealousy. Contrary to the stereotype of pure rage, many hannya masks are carved with subtle asymmetries that imply lingering humanity. Viewed from oblique angles, the mouth can seem to quiver between scream and sob, and the gold-leafed eyes oscillate between menace and vulnerability.</p>
      <p>Techniques of making a mask are themselves a historical archive. Carvers follow inherited templates that specify interocular width, nose bridge, and mouth depth while leaving room for individual interpretation. Pigments and natural patination record centuries of handling. Surface wear around the nose or chin often tells us how a particular family troupe used the piece, and wormholes or repairs become evidence of transmission rather than damage to be erased. Contemporary scholarship increasingly treats masks as performance-based objects whose meanings are completed not in vitrines but in motion, sound, and ritual context.</p>
      <p>Understanding Noh masks therefore requires a threefold approach: form, technique, and stage practice. Form asks how volumes and edges collect light. Technique asks how gesso, lacquer, and carving produce those volumes. Stage practice asks how an actor’s kata—codified patterns of movement—turn the object into a living face. When these three converge, a mask becomes a hinge between human performers and the spirits or archetypes they articulate. In this sense Noh masks are less about hiding identity than about making visible the layered temporality of the theater itself: the present body, the remembered role, and a long chain of hands stretching back through time.</p>
