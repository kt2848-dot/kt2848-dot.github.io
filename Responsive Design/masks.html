        <h1>Typology</h1>
        <p>Noh masks are organised into families that help performers and audiences read role, age and social status. The <em>onna</em> group includes young and mature women such as <em>ko-omote</em> or <em>shakumi</em>. The <em>otoko</em> group contains warriors, courtiers and commoners. The <em>kishin</em> group covers gods, demons and animal spirits, ranging from serene deities to ferocious <em>shikami</em>. Specialised categories such as <em>okina</em> function as ritual presences, while masks for madwomen or ghosts mark psychological and spiritual rupture.</p>

        <h2>Making</h2>
        <p>Traditional masks are carved from a single block of <em>hinoki</em> cypress. After roughing out the form with chisels, the carver gradually refines planes around the eyes, nose and mouth to control how shadows will fall. Several coats of gofun gesso smooth the surface, followed by pigments and layers of urushi lacquer. Teeth may be picked out in black or gold, and hairlines are painted with extremely fine brushwork. Finally, the back of the mask is hollowed to fit comfortably against the actor’s face while leaving enough thickness to remain durable.</p>

        <h2>Workshop Measurements</h2>
        <p>Carving manuals specify key measurements such as the distance between the pupils, the height of the cheekbones and the depth of the mouth cavity. Small deviations from these standards can dramatically shift the mood of a mask: a slightly wider eye or lower brow may make a character appear more anxious or severe. Over time, wear patterns and repairs on historic pieces reveal how particular troupes handled them, turning each mask into a physical record of performance history.</p>
